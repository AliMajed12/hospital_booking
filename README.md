# hospital booking by Eng.Ali Al-Harthi
Project objective 
1- Assisting hospitals in managing the clinic reservation system 
2- The ability of reviewers, students, and faculty members at Najran University to book 
appointments for clinics remotely
3- We motivate each hospital to use this system to make this system a success with its ease 
and speed of response and meet the needs of the browser and the wishes and capabilities 
of the hospital.
Project goal
Helping students and faculty members at Najran University to conserve their time and determine 
the times that suit them to visit the hospital because of the synchronization of times in the hospital 
clinics and times of lectures or scientific affiliation at the university and the distance to the 
university headquarters from the university hospital.
Project scope 
Najran University Hospital and all medical sectors and hospitals.
Project description 
We have noticed that the clinic booking system is a difficult process, so we designed this system 
to help hospitals manage the appointment booking system and the convenience of references with 
the development of technology with this application.
We make it easy for the user with the following steps:
1- - The user creates an account linked to his university number and his password, and then 
sends the references file number to the phone number previously registered in the 
university portal.
2- After registration and logging in, the auditor can choose the clinic to visit and choose the 
appropriate time available.
3- After booking, Almarai is alerted to confirm the reservation via a message sent to his 
mobile phone registered with the university.
4- Remind the references 24 hours before the appointment.
The administrator of this system has all the powers, some of which are:
1- Add a clinic
2- Delete a clinic
3- Add booking times
4- Withholding booking times for suspended clinics
5- Add the names of the doctors on duty in the clinic and other tasks.

Project plan 
Our plan is to market this idea and make all hospitals use this system 
Methodology 
First we will make screen diagram then we’ll make sequence and ER also we’ll make functional 
specification finally we will code the system using flutter framework
project purpose
The first purpose is for profit by selling the application to the University Hospital in Najran or any 
hospital that may need such a distinguished application.
The second purpose is to meet the hospital's need for such an application to manage appointment 
bookings
The last purpose is to solve the problem of patients visiting the hospital and coming from long 
distances, despite the fact that there is no confirmed appointment until after the first visit and 
reservation of an appointment
